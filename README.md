# surfspec: UGent PAE tools for imaging spectroscopy of macrophytes and sediments

This package contains a bundle of R functions developed for internal use at the Protistology and Aquatic Ecology (PAE) research group from Ghent University, Belgium. Its development is not intended for public release of an R package, but is mainatined in GitHub for collaboration and documentation of methods. The functions are developed for improved calculation of in air hemispherical-directional reflectance of macrophytes and sediment cores, with specific functions for sediment reflectance profiles. Current instrumentation at PAE consist of an imaging spectrometer (SOC-710P, Surface Optics Corporation), a NIST traceable grey card and natural illumination. But should be applicable to other setups with similar data porcessing/extraction needs.
